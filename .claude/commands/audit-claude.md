Audit Claude Code configuration for consistency and issues.

Use the claude-config-auditor agent to analyze:
- CLAUDE.md project instructions
- .claude/agents/ configurations
- .claude/commands/ definitions
- .claude/skills/ content
- Cross-references between all configuration files

Identify conflicts, redundancies, outdated references, and misalignments, then provide remediation recommendations.
